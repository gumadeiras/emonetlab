    Thierry Emonet is a Lewis B. Cullman Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, and Professor of Physics, at Yale University. His research combines mathematical modeling and quantitative experiments to understand the biological computations that enable organisms to sense and navigate their chemical environments. As model systems, his lab uses bacterial chemotaxis and fly olfaction, in which they can make multi-scale measurements and compare to quantitative mathematical models. Navigation requires performing many non-trivial computations and can be quantified precisely. The Emonet lab exploits this quantitative framework for discovering how biological systems compute, and how computations are implemented in molecular and cellular mechanisms. Before coming to Yale in 2007, Thierry studied physics at the ETH Zürich. He received his PhD (cum laude) in theoretical astrophysics from the University of La Laguna (Spain) in 1998, before doing postdocs at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder CO and The University of Chicago, discovering key mechanisms that enable magnetic field to float to the surface of the Sun to create Sunspots. During his postdoc Thierry became fascinated with the question of where individuality comes from and what is its functional role in life and he switched to biology. His work is supported by NIH, NSF, the Paul G Allen Family Foundation (Distinguished Allen Investigator), the Whitehall Foundation, the James S. McDonnell Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Outside of science, Thierry’s main interest is art. He grew up at the intersection of science and art and he is married to renowned sculptor [Susan Clinard](http://www.clinard.org/).

    Jyot is a joint postdoc with [Paul Turner Lab](https://turnerlab.yale.edu/). Jyot worked on his PhD with [Pushkar Lele](http://pushkarlelelab.org/) at Texas A&M University where he studied the sensory functions of the bacterial flagellar motor. He is currently developing a project to visualize and study the interactions between bacteria and bacteriophage- the viruses that infect bacteria. In his free time, Jyot enjoys reading fantasy novels, taking road trips to parks and beaches, cooking, and eating.

    Swayamshree is working on the theoretical aspects of chemical navigation. She finished her PhD at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur under the guidance of Debashish Chowdhury where she developed theories for control and coordination of flagellar length in multiflagellated eukaryotes. In her free time she loves to explore new techniques of digital art for communicating her scientific projects.

    Gustavo completed his undergraduate in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, where he studied the ontogeny of vocal communication in mice. He is currently interested in understanding how flies explore spatiotemporal features of odor plumes for optimal navigation. In his free time, he spends too much money going to concerts, and enjoys playing guitar.
