    Ravi is an undergraduate interested in the living world and how it is structured on mathematical, physical, and biological levels. He is currently studying how E. coli adapt to their environment and how they spatially organize themselves during group migration. In his free time he enjoys hiking, magical realist literature (Borges in particular), playing sitar, the card game Magic the Gathering, and hosting study breaks for his friends. He also enjoys solving puzzles and making puns.

- name: Samuel Brudner
  role: Postdoc

  description: >
    Sam is interested in the mechanics of adaptive animal behavior. He studies how hungry fruit flies decide where to look for food based on patterns in the odors drifting over them. He was previously a grad student at Duke with Dr. Richard Mooney where he studied how young finches learn to imitate the songs of adult birds. He hopes that studying how animals solve tasks, we will broaden our understanding of what intelligence is, and how brains create it. Apart from neuroscience, Sam likes food, music, dancing, and learning about native plants and animals where he lives.

- name: Thierry Emonet
  role: Principal Investigator

  description: > # Can be Markdown
    Thierry is the Lewis B. Cullman Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, and Professor of Physics, at Yale University. His research combines mathematical modeling and quantitative experiments to understand the biological computations that enable organisms to sense and navigate their chemical environments. As model systems, his lab uses bacterial chemotaxis and fly olfaction, in which they can make multi-scale measurements and compare to quantitative mathematical models. Navigation requires performing many non-trivial computations and can be quantified precisely. The Emonet lab exploits this quantitative framework for discovering how biological systems compute, and how computations are implemented in molecular and cellular mechanisms. Before coming to Yale in 2007, Thierry studied physics at the ETH Zürich. He received his PhD (cum laude) in theoretical astrophysics from the University of La Laguna (Spain) in 1998, before doing postdocs at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder CO and The University of Chicago, discovering key mechanisms that enable magnetic field to float to the surface of the Sun to create Sunspots. During his postdoc Thierry became fascinated with the question of where individuality comes from and what is its functional role in life and he switched to biology. His work is supported by NIH, NSF, the Paul G Allen Family Foundation (Distinguished Allen Investigator), the Whitehall Foundation, the James S. McDonnell Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Outside of science, Thierry’s main interest is art. He grew up at the intersection of science and art and he is married to renowned sculptor [Susan Clinard](http://www.clinard.org/).
